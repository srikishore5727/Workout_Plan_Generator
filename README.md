## üß† How It Works

MyFitMantra follows a straightforward process to create your custom workout plan:

1.  **User Input:** You submit your preferences (experience, equipment, days/week, goal) via the intuitive web form.
2.  **Exercise Filtering:** The system intelligently filters its comprehensive exercise database based on:
    *   Your available equipment.
    *   Your declared experience level (ensuring appropriate exercise complexity).
    *   Your selected fitness goal (influencing exercise selection, rep ranges, and volume).
3.  **Workout Split Creation:** Based on the `days_per_week`, a balanced workout split is determined (e.g., 3 days might be Push/Pull/Legs, while 2 days might be Full Body A/B).
4.  **Progressive Plan Generation:** A 4-week plan (totaling 12 sessions if 3 days/week) is generated. Progression might be implicitly built-in through exercise variety or suggested intensity.
5.  **Structured Output:** The system returns a well-structured workout plan for each session, including:
    *   Specific **Warm-up** exercises and durations.
    *   The **Main Workout** with exercises, sets, and reps.
    *   Suggested **Cool-down** activities.
